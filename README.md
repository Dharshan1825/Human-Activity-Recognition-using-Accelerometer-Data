# Human Activity Recognition using Accelerometer Data

This live script performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature extraction
on smartphone accelerometer data for human activity recognition.

The analysis includes:
- Time-domain statistical features
- Frequency-domain analysis using FFT
- Visualization using scatter plots and heatmaps
- Clustering and silhouette analysis
